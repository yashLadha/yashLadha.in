This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is my portfolio designed in react. This is a starter project to learn React. I also have used Material-UI in
restyling the material components on the website.

For executing the code

```sh
> cd portfolio
> yarn start
```

I have used firebase for the deployment. To deploy using firebase use:

```sh
> yarn build
> firebase deploy
```
