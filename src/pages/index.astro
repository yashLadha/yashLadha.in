      I am a software engineer and an engineering leader passionate about System architecture, Language internals,
      Framework internals and Advanced Algorithms. I have also worked as an ex-collaborator on the <a
        href="https://github.com/nodejs/node"
        rel="noreferrer nofollow">Node.js</a
      > project, where I helped improve the runtime and fix bugs.

      <br /><br />

      I have over 5 years of experience in building valuable software solutions. I've worked across the full stack -
      frontend, backend, and mobile development - leaving no area untouched. I've had the privilege of working with
      great companies like <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BrowserStack</a> and <a
        href="https://shipsy.io/"
        rel="noreferrer nofollow">Shipsy</a
      >, helping them build impactful products for their customers.

      <br /><br />

      I'm an avid open-source contributor, and whenever I get the chance, I enjoy giving back to the community. I was a
      Google Summer of Code fellow with FOSSASIA, and I've also contributed to several popular open-source projects like <a
        href="https://github.com/nodejs/node"
        rel="noreferrer nofollow">Node.js</a
      >, <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/badgeyay" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BadgeYay </a>and <a
        href="https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis"
        rel="noreferrer nofollow">Jarvis</a
      > - all of which have over 10,000 stars on their repositories.
